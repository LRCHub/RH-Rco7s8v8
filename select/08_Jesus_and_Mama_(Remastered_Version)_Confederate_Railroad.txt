I made a wish upon a star
I could have a brand new car
Got tired of wishing
So I stole one

Seventeen and knew it all
My dreams were big
But my thoughts were small
So many roads somehow
I chose the wrong one

But Jesus and Mama always loved me
Even when the Devil took control
Jesus and Mama always loved me
This I know

I felt tried most all my life
Found new kinds of lows and highs
Never been a husband
But I had a lot of wives
To hold me

Headstrong, stubborn, couldn't be told
Like a wild horse that couldn't be rode
A rainbow chaser hungry for gold
And still searchin'

But Jesus and Mama always loved me
Even when the Devil took control
Jesus and Mama always loved me
This I know

I wish mom could see me now
And how I've turned it all around
Lately I've been going down
The right road

Life's a picture that you paint
With blues and grays
And cans and can'ts
Heaven knows I'm not a saint
But I know

Jesus and Mama always loved me
Even when the Devil took control
Jesus and Mama always loved me
This I know
